# on the filesystem, referred to below as writefile; the second argument is a text string which will 
# be written within this file, referred to below as writestr

# Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments above were not specified

# Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, overwriting any existing file 
# and creating the path if it doesnâ€™t exist. Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file 
# could not be created.
